LD30 Test
=========

This file contains a skeleton framework for using LibGDX and Ashley. You should be able to compile 
this either on command-line or using your chosen IDE.

See https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Setting-up-your-Development-Environment-%28Eclipse%2C-Intellij-IDEA%2C-NetBeans%29 
for Eclipse, IntelliJ-IDEA and NetBeans installation details (you don't need Android/iOS stuff)

For compiling, see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Project-Setup-Gradle and choose your IDE.

Upon finishing compilation you should be able to go to desktop/build/libs/desktop-1.0.jar and run it.
